# You are going to write a program that will mark a spot with an X.
# In the starting code, you will find a variable called map.
# This map contains a nested list. When map is printed this is what the nested list looks like:
# [['⬜️', '⬜️', '⬜️'],['⬜️', '⬜️', '⬜️'],['⬜️', '⬜️', '⬜️']]
# This is a bit hard to work with. So on lines 6 and 23, we've used this line of code print(f"{row1}\n{row2}\n{row3}" to format the 3 lists to be printed as a 3 by 3 square, each on a new line. 
# ['⬜️', '⬜️', '⬜️']
# ['⬜️', '⬜️', '⬜️']
# ['⬜️', '⬜️', '⬜️']
 
row1 = ['⬜️', '⬜️', '⬜️']
row2 = ['⬜️', '⬜️', '⬜️']
row3 = ['⬜️', '⬜️', '⬜️']
map = [row1, row2, row3]
print(f"{row1}\n{row2}\n{row3}")
number = input("select a column and a row (eg 23):   ")
map[int(number[1]) - 1][int(number[0]) - 1]="X"
print(f"{row1}\n{row2}\n{row3}")
